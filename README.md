A HapiJS plugin to log requests and subsegments through AWSXray.

## Setup

At the moment, the plugin relies on the AWS credentials being set before being registered, or it will pull them from 
`~/.aws/credentials` as per the SDK default.

It basically works a lot like the Official Express version, however you use the HapiJS syntax to register the plugin (as
opposed to `app.use(AWSXRay.express.openSegment('defaultName'))`)

For more details on using X-Ray, see the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-nodejs/latest/reference)

It currently only works in 'manual' mode, setting the current 'segment' on each request.

## Usage

Simply register as a normal plugin

```js

const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk');

await server.register({
  register: require('hapi-xray').register,
  options: {
    captureAWS: true,
    plugins: [AWSXRay.plugins.ECSPlugin]
  }
});
```

You can then use the X-Ray SDK as normal in your routes taking the current segment from the request

```js

server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/items',
  handler: async (request, h) => {
    const segment = request.segment;
    segment.addAnnotation('hitController', 'true');
    
    return {};
  }
});
```

### Options

- `plugins` An array of AWS plugins to use (i.e. `[AWSXRay.plugins.EC2Plugin]`)
- `captureAWS` Enables AWS X-Ray to capture AWS calls
  - This requires having `aws-sdk` installed as a dependency
- `setLogger` Bind AWS X-Ray to a compatible logging interface `({ trace, debug, info })`
